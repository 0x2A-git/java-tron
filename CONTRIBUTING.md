## Contribution guidelines

### Pull requests

First of all. java-tron follow the gitflow. So please send you pull request 
to **develop** branch. We will close the pull request to master branch.

We are always happy to receive pull requests, and do our best to
review them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull
request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be
discouraged! Sometimes we can make a mistake, please do more explaining 
for us. We will appreciate it.

### Create issues

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/tron-network/java-tron/issues) before anybody
starts working on it. 

Also when filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

### but check existing issues and docs first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist
documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it
never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will
help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
